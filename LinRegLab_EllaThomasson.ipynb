        "Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables in a regression model are highly correlated, which can lead to unreliable estimates of coefficients and inflated standard errors. In terms of two-stage least squares. in many cases, multicollinearity can arise from endogeneity, where an independent variable is correlated with the error term due to omitted variable bias, measurement errors, or simultaneous relationships. When multicollinearity exists alongside endogeneity, traditional methods like Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) can yield biased estimates."
